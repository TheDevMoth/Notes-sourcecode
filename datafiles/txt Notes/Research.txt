After doing some research I am quite sure that:

They do in fact like cats.
I hired a cat groomer, she doesn't like black cats.
One probably hit her and that is why she doesn't like them.
There was a man that lost his cat
He described it to I, no.. to Me
The cat is black she hides her collar but know that it is purple, she also has green eyes
maybe I can try to make machine that finds lost cats that would be cool
but that would take like at least 6 years
I can look, she might be in a birch tree
I like birch trees; she might not. they're near streets so she will get scared by the cars. That is why you keep cats away from birch trees Richard
